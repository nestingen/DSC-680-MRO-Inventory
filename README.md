# DSC-680-MRO-Inventory
For manufacturing companies, Maintenance, Repair, and Operations Inventory can be a large expense. This inventory group is known as MRO Inventory. These parts are used to maintain and repair the machines that are used in the manufacturing process as well as equipment needed to preform the operations. This could include motors, screws, or personal protective equipment (PPE). Inventory must be watched because there is a cost of too high or low of levels. When Inventory is too high, too much money is tied up in parts. This means the capital cannot be used elsewhere in the business. When inventory is too low, a machine repair could lead to costly down time. In this project, I investigated why inventory is changing at 30 plants across a company. By slicing the data different ways, I was able to pinpoint why inventory was increasing or decreasing at a plant. I used Qlik Sense to perform this analysis. Qlik Sense is a BI tool like Tableau. This tool is used company wide and everyone has access to this analysis. Storeroom managers can use this report to explain MRO Inventory Changes. I focused on March 2020 to December 2020 to do a different dive into the analysis.
